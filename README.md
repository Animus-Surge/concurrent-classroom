# Concurrent Classroom
Ever since concurrent learning started in Virginia, it's been pretty hard for students in the classroom to communicate with their peers or their teacher out of the classroom. This is a tool to make that much easier.

This is a chat based communication tool that is intended to be used in the classroom setting. The teacher sets up a class chat, then the students can join that class through a special code that is provided by the teacher, and then students inside the classroom can communicate with students out of the classroom, or students in the classroom can communicate with their teacher who's out of the classroom.
